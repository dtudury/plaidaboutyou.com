I didn't start this project because I thought weaving was cool. But I do now. If you're new to weaving, watch [this video about weaving](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2018/its-just-matrix-multiplication-notation-for-weaving.html). Weaving is awesome!

## What is PlaidAboutYou?

PlaidAboutYou is a virtual loom. It renders fabrics defined using a weaving draft metaphor, webGL, and a custom pattern describing language.
* The weaving draft metaphor is used because it's powerful but still fun.
* webGL allows the fabric to be textured at the thread level. Currently it's only used to provide a subtle gradient on the threads but more is certainly possible
* The pattern describing language handles named patterns, repetitions, offsets, reversals, and subpatterns.

## the language

* **named patterns**: the `VARS=` sections is a dictionary of patterns and values. `RED:0xff0000` stores the color red. `STRAIGHT:[1,2,3,4]` stores a straight draw pattern
* **repetitions**: patterns can be repeated. `RED*20` is 20 red threads next to each other. `[1,2,3,4]*2` outputs `[1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4]`
* **reversals**: patterns can be reversed. `-[1,2,3,4]` outputs `[4,3,2,1]`
* **offsets**: patterns can be offset. Offsets are applied *after* the pattern is output. `[1,2,3]+10` outputs `[1,2,3]`. `[1,2,3]+10*2` outputs `[1,2,3,11,12,13]`. Reversed offsets are subtracted instead of added. if `N` is set as `1+1` (a value that starts at 1 and increases by 1 each time it's called) then `[N*3,-N*3]` outputs ` [1,2,3,4,3,2]`
* **subpatterns**: `[[1,2]+10*2]+100*2` outputs `[1,2,11,12,121,122,131,132]`. This is because it's a parsed language (not because I'm imagining a use case)

## the tie-up

The tie-up is a comma separated list of binary numbers. The leftmost digit of the first number is whether the top left corner is on or off. The rightmost digit of the last number is the bottom right.

* `S:[A*3,B*6,A*6,C*21,D];` stripes of varios widths
* `P:[S,-S]___` same stripes forwards and backwards
* `WARP=P___WEFT=P___` same stripes in both axes
* `THREADING=[1,2,3,4]___TREADLING=[1,2,3,4]___` straight draw

* `CONSTANTS=treadles:4;shafts:4;scale:3`


## features to add

* 3d string textures: I'm using 3d rendering but only to do very light shading to imply direction
* physical modeling: what happens when you have a bunch of floats next to each other on real fabric? can we predict that behavior?
